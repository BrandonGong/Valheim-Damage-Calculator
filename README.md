## How to Use
Start by selecting foods from the drop down lists. This will determine your maximum health, which has a direct factor on your stagger bar. 
Armour can be selected from the drop downs along with their teir, or a custom value can be set. If you are using a shield, you may select
that from the drop down, or set a custom value. The parry option may be selected to calculate block damage using a parry bonus. Finally, 
either enter in the amount of damage you anticipate taking, or select the creature you're interested in along with how many stars they have.

The results will be shown in the section below with unblocked damage being the amount of damage if you did not successfully block an attack. 
The Blocking Damage will show the damage taken if the block was successful. When recieving too much damage, a block may fail and the damage 
will be the same as unblocked, however, the player will be staggered. Additionally, each section will show the how full the stagger meter 
will be after recieving a hit.
